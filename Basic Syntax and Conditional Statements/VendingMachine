//Your task is to calculate the total purchase price from a vending machine.
// Until you receive "Start" you will be given different coins that are being inserted into the machine.
// You have to sum them to have the total money inserted. There is a problem though.
// Your vending machine only works with 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, and 2 coins.
// If someone tries to insert some other coins, you have to display "Cannot accept {money}",
// where the value is formatted to the second digit after the decimal point and not add it to the total money.
// On the next few lines until you receive "End" you will be given products to purchase.
// Your machine has, however, only "Nuts", "Water", "Crisps", "Soda", "Coke".
// The prices are: 2.0, 0.7, 1.5, 0.8, 1.0 respectively.
// If the person tries to purchase a not existing product, print "Invalid product".
// Be careful that the person may try to purchase a product for which he doesn't have money.
// In that case, print "Sorry, not enough money". If the person purchases a product successfully
//print "Purchased {product name}".
// After the "End" command, print the money that is left formatted to the second decimal point
// in the format "Change: {money left}".

//Example

//Input:
//Input
//1
//1
//0.5
//0.6
//Start
//Coke
//Soda
//Crisps
//End

//Output:
//Cannot accept 0.60
//Purchased Coke
//Purchased Soda
//Sorry, not enough money
//Change: 0.70
