//Let's take a break and visit the game bar at SoftUni.
//It is about time for the people behind the bar to go home,
//and you are the person who has to draw the line and calculate the money
//from the products that were sold throughout the day.
//Until you receive a line with the text "end of shift",
//you will be given lines of input. But before processing that line,
//you have to do some validations first.

//Each valid order should have a customer, product, count, and price:

//Valid customer's name should be surrounded by '%' and must start with
//a capital letter, followed by lower-case letters.

//Valid product contains any word character and must be surrounded by '<' and '>'.
//The valid count is an integer surrounded by '|'.
//The valid price is any real number followed by '$'.

//The parts of a valid order should appear in the order given:
//customer, product, count, and price.

//Between each part there can be other symbols, except ('|', '$', '%' and '. ')

//For each valid line print on the console: "{customerName}: {product} - {totalPrice}"

//When you receive "end of shift", print the total amount of money
//for the day rounded to 2 decimal places in the following format:
//"Total income: {income}".

//Input / Constraints
//Strings must be processed until you receive the text "end of shift".

//Output
//Print all the valid lines in the format "{customerName}: {product} - {totalPrice}".
//Â· After receiving "end of shift" print the total amount of money for
//the day rounded to 2 decimal places in the following format:
//"Total income: {income}".

//Example

//Input:
//%George%<Croissant>|2|10.3$
//%Peter%<Gum>|1|1.3$
//%Maria%<Cola>|1|2.4$
//end of shift

//Output:
//George: Croissant - 20.60
//Peter: Gum - 1.30
//Maria: Cola - 2.40
//Total income: 24.30
